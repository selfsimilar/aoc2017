[Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017)

A fun diversion for the holidays (ho ho ho).

I'm not nearly quick enough to actually get points (nor am I often enough awake when the each day opens), but it's fun.

>These are your personal leaderboard statistics. Rank is your position on that leaderboard: 1 means you were the first person to get that star, 2 means the second, 100 means the 100th, etc. Score is the number of points you got for that rank: 100 for 1st, 99 for 2nd, ..., 1 for 100th, and 0 otherwise.
